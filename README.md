# 555 Timer LED Blinker (NE55P)

This is a basic electronics project using the NE555 timer IC configured in **astable mode** to blink an LED. Designed for learning PCB design with KiCad, it demonstrates how to use common components like resistors, capacitors, and an LED.

## ⚙️ Features
- NE55P timer in astable mode
- Blinking LED output
- Easy through-hole components
- Designed in KiCad 7

## 🧰 Components Used
- NE555P (DIP-8)
- 1kΩ Resistor
- 10kΩ Resistor
- 10µF Capacitor (Electrolytic)
- 0.01µF Capacitor (Ceramic)
- Red LED
- Power Supply (5V–9V)
- 330Ω LED current-limiting resistor

## 🛠️ Files Included
- Schematic (`.kicad_sch`)
